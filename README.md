A clone of robinHood with a Twist


This is just me following a tutorial but iplab on forking it and making a unique version of mine later on.

There are going to be some features used.

Backend is sanity, server hosting for database is moralis, frontend is NextJS and deplloyment will be me using github to push it out to netlify.

I'm Not the best but i hope you can follow along.
